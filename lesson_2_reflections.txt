Lesson 2 Problem set 1

Commit 547f4171a82ec6429d002c1acef357aec41d3f17 introduced the sprite bug. 

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- .git directory with content created.
- files in pwd remain, but not necessarily tracked. 

----
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers? 

Files 'in' the staging area represents a metadata concept only. The files
don't actually exist in a staging area, only the concept that they exist in a
staging area exists.
