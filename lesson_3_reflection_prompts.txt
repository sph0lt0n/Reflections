When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

allows for colaboration.
transparent backups

----
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Avoid changes made by others. 

----
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

Use fork to make a private GitHub copy of someone elses GitHub repository.
Use clone to make a new copy of an existing repository. The source can
be either a local (or remote) git repository, or a GitHub repository.
Use branch to create a private stream within an existing repository

----
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the
remote stored locally?

continue to work off-line
isolation from changes in a busy repository.
ability to create multiole commits in a private stream.



----
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be
easier, and what would be harder?

The tool enforces a process, which may not be the process people would
select. To the extent Git/GitHub fails to adhere to the process people
choose to use, it would be inefficient. 

----
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than
directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Changes in a seperate brance keeps master pure, and limits the deltas.
